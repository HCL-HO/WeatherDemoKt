# WeatherDemoKt
Demo App Using Kotlin, MVVM, unit test, instrumented test

## A Demo App developed for the following requirements

High-level requirements:
The following list of functional requirements is prioritized. Implement as many of these points
as you can, given the time you have. Do only as much as your time allows, while we favor
“quality over quantity”.
1. Search by city name or zip code
Implement a search to allow the user to enter a city name or zip code. The result of the
search is to display the current weather information for the searched location.
2. Search by GPS
On the same search screen, also allow users to use GPS location instead to get
current weather information.
3. Most recent search location loads automatically
When you come back to the app after closing it, the weather for the most recent search
is displayed.
4. Recent Searches
Implement a screen that lists recently searched locations. You can tap on a recent
search location and see the current weather location.
5. Delete recent searches
Provide the ability to delete one or more recently searched locations.
6.Multi-market
Implement the app in such a way that it can be shipped to two different countries with a
different app name in each country.
● Australia: "My Aussie Weather"
● Canada: "My Eh Weather"
If possible, use a different color scheme for each country.

Hard requirements:
● Use the OpenWeatherMap API:
